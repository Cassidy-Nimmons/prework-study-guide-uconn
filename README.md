# Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motvation was to create a space where I can easily acess notes that I will need throughout the coding bootcamp and my future career in the software development world
- I built this project to not only practice the basics of coding, but to understand how code works while also creating a space to keep all my notes surrounding coding
- This website solves the problem of where I am going to keep notes, rather than just writing them down or having them in different spots, I can write down what I really want, and then later add it to my website, or just add the notes directly to the website if I feel as though I don't need to write them down.
- I learned how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript function together and seperatly. I also learned the basics of these three coding languages as well as how to apply them. Lastly, I learned how to have a balance between learning code, applying code, and having a healthy lifestyle while learning such an in depth and complicated subject.

## How to Contribute
